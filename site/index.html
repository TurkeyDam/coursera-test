        <p class="menu-item-details text-left">Chicken is an all-time favorite for weeknight dinners, but so many of us end up making the same few dishes over and over again. 
          Sure, we all need our go-to family meal ideas (and you'll find some in here!) but we have to mix things up once in a while, and this list will help! We've put together a collection of some of the absolute best chicken dinner recipes out there. There are healthy chicken recipes like salads that will please any crowd, Instant Pot chicken recipes you can "set and forget," and grilled chicken recipes that are perfect for summer dinners outside. Browse through these options that'll get you inspired: We've included easy sheet-pan chicken dinners, soups you can make in the slow cooker, and even side dishes for chicken that are bound to get the kids excited, like chicken and waffles. Best of all, these picks will make for an easy grocery-shopping trip: They come together with simple, no-fuss ingredients that you can find at your local supermarket. 
          Whether you're searching for the perfect Southern comfort food recipe, a Sunday dinner idea, or a make-ahead chicken recipe that allows you to spend less time in the kitchen, our list has plenty of options. Start browsing!
          You’ll need a heavy, wide, high-sided skillet with a lid. Cast iron is preferred for the even heat it provides and retains. Ideally, the skillet will be 11 or 12 inches across so more than a few pieces of chicken fit at a time. An enameled cast-iron pot also works.
          A candy thermometer is helpful to gauge the heat of the oil in the pan. You want it running at 350 degrees. No candy thermometer? You can flick a little flour into your heated oil. If it sizzles furiously you’re in the right neighborhood.
          Traditionalists like to put their seasoned flour into a big brown paper bag, so they can add the chicken to it and shake it around to coat the meat. If you don’t have one, a large bowl with high sides will do.
          A baking sheet wire rack will come in handy for draining the finished chicken. Some cooks make do with more brown paper bags, or even newspaper, but that can lead to soggy skin.
          Delicious fried chicken starts with the bird. You can cut a whole chicken into parts for frying, but if you want all dark meat, or vice versa, or just to save time, you can buy the parts.
          Maybe you’re feeding a bunch of children who prefer drumsticks, or someone who will only eat white meat. Buying parts lets you tailor the meal to their tastes.
          For dark meat aficionados, go for a mixture of drumsticks and bone-in thighs. For those who prefer white meat, a pack of bone-in breasts will do just fine. Figure on two or three pieces per person, plus leftovers because cold fried chicken eaten the next day is fantastic.
          A whole chicken of 3 or 4 pounds can be cut into 10 parts for frying: two drumsticks, two thighs, two wings and the two breasts each cut in two, with the backbone discarded. This will feed four people nicely. (Here’s a video demonstrating how to do that.)
          Buy the freshest chicken you can at the store, organic if possible.
